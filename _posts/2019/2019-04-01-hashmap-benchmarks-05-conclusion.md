In conclusion, I can only say one thing with certainty: there is not one single best hashmap. What's best for you will depend on your usecase, and I advise you to create a representative benchmark for your use case, then run all the maps against it. Make sure your benchmark is unbiased and that the complier can't optimize important work away.

## Hashes

This summary is simple: in *all* benchmarks where hashing was involved, `robin_hood::hash` is overall the fastest. Only for long strings you might want to consider `absl::Hash` instead. I can only warn from the `libstdc++-v3` default implementation. Only use it if you are absolutely sure about what data you insert.

## Hashmaps

If you are dealing with small maps and integral data types as keys, `emilib1::HashMap` might be fastest. But be aware that I cannot vouch for it's stability. It is very new, and while integrating it the author still had to fix a few kinks to get it working. If it works for you, it's search performance is very fast. If you want a more stable map with very good performance, I'd go for `absl::flat_hash_map` as the default map. It is very stable, and has lots of features.

If your map is modified with inserts and removals a lot, `tsl::robin_map` is fastest. It has high memory usage though. `robin_hood::unordered_flat_map` is slightly slower but has much less memory requirements.

If your key is relatively slow to hash and to compare, like for a `std::string`, `robin_hood::unordered_node_map` is the way to go. It's memory usage is quite low and it is fastest.

Sometimes it is very important to iterate the maps data very fast, e.g. in games. In that case, `tsl::sparse_map` is the clear winner. Iteration is exceptionally fast, it uses little memory, and find & insert & erase performance is ok as well.

# Summary

I hope these benchmarks are helpful to you!
