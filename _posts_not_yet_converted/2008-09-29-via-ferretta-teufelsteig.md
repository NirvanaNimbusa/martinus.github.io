This sunday I was on a fabulous via ferrata (german translation is "Klettersteig"). Here is a video of it:





The via feretta is called [Teufelsteig](http://www.bergsteigen.at/de/touren.aspx?ID=408) which translates to devli's steep road.

Walking through difficult terrain, close to the peak ![](http://martin.ankerl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/t1.jpg)

A view around to nearby peaks and chines ![](http://martin.ankerl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/t2.jpg)

Finally, after about 4 hours hiking and climbing, we have reached the peak of 1822m and enjoy the view :) ![](http://martin.ankerl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/t3.jpg)
