Some time ago there was a question on [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) that asked [how people read papers](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/794).


	

My problem is to quickly select the most promissing papers from the [gazillions that are available](http://martinus.geekisp.com/?p=36). So, this is how I do it:


	


	
  1. Read the title

	
  2. Quickly skim the abstract - get an overview what it is all about

	
  3. Read the conclusion - find out what the paper really wants to tell you

	
  4. Really read the abstract - find out how the paper comes to the conclusion

	
  5. Read TOC - find out which chapters are worth reading

	
  6. Read the chapters that are worth reading.

	
	

After each step I decide if it is worth to spend more time on it or to move on to other papers.
