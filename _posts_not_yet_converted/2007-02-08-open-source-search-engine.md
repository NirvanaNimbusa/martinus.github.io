Thanks to Google's new [co-op](http://www.google.com/coop/) feature I was able to create a customized search engine for open source software. It contains a lot of hosting sites like [sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/) and [rubyforge.org](http://rubyforge.org/), but also lots of other sites like [eclipse.org](http://www.eclipse.org/), [kernel.org](http://kernel.org/), [apache.org](http://apache.org/) and many many more.
